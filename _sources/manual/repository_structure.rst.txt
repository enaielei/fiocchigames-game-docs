Repository Structure
====================

This document outlines the structure of the repository, including game content, documentation sources, build outputs, and utility scripts.

Project Root
------------

- ``game/`` — Root directory containing all game logic and assets.
- ``docs/`` — All Sphinx documentation sources, configuration, and output.
- ``_templates/`` — `Hygen <https://www.hygen.io/>`_ templates used for generating boilerplate code or files.
- ``requirements.txt`` — Python package dependencies, including Sphinx and any extensions.
- ``restruct.py`` — Custom script used to generate `.rst` files from `.rpy` and `.rpym` game script files.
- ``.gitignore`` — Specifies intentionally untracked files to be ignored by Git.

Game Code and Assets
--------------------

- ``game/images/`` — Contains image assets like sprites, UI elements, and backgrounds.
- ``game/scripts/`` — Game logic and dialogue scripts.

  - ``core/`` — Foundational logic shared across the project.

    - ``models/`` — Defines core data structures such as Actors, Items, Quests, etc.
    - ``utils/`` — Shared utility functions and helpers used by core logic.

Documentation (docs/)
---------------------

All documentation-related files and configurations reside in the `docs/` directory.

- ``conf.py`` — Sphinx configuration file defining extensions, paths, and theme settings.
- ``index.rst`` — Main index file that defines the structure of the documentation.
- ``generated/`` — `.rst` files automatically generated by `restruct.py` from game scripts.
- ``manual/`` — Manually authored documentation such as setup guides and technical references.
- ``_build/`` — Output folder generated by Sphinx when building documentation (e.g., HTML).
- ``_static/`` — Static assets like images or custom stylesheets used in documentation.
- ``make.bat`` — Windows-specific script to build the Sphinx documentation.
- ``Makefile`` — Unix/Linux/macOS version of the Sphinx build script.

Notes
-----

- Files under `docs/generated/` are automatically created and **should not be edited manually**.
- Use ``make html`` (Unix/macOS) or ``make.bat html`` (Windows) **from within the `docs/` folder** to build the HTML documentation.
- Hygen templates in `_templates/` help standardize boilerplate code and project structure.
